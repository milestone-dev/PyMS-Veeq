# PyMS
PyMS is a cross platform BroodWar modding suite written using [Python](http://www.python.org). PyMS contains 15 programs to edit most of the file types you will encounter while modding. This modding suite was originally created by poiuy_qwert and has since been maintained by Neiv, iquare, Veeq7, DarkenedFantasies, and Pr0nogo. This repository is home to the final updates the suite will see from us before a new modding suite enters development.
