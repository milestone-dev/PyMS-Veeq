PyTILE:
- Option to delete megatiles that are not used by any tile groups.
- Selecting multiple groups in the main window (mostly for shifting them all to null, applying megatile flags to all of them like walkable/low/med/high etc, and setting them to unbuildable
- Changing Zoom Scale does not save scrolling progress correctly.
- Reuse MiniTiles Duplicates Old/New and Null settings don't work when importing minitile graphics

PyMS:
Warning on overwriting default files, just a luxury for the idiots among us who mod while half asleep (aka me). I actually think this is partially functional for some programs, but notably PyAI does not have any countermeasure in place.
