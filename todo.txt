PyTILE:
- Option to delete megatiles that are not used by any tile groups.
- Selecting multiple groups in the main window (mostly for shifting them all to null, applying megatile flags to all of them like walkable/low/med/high etc, and setting them to unbuildable
- Option to preview minitile flags in the same/similar way to SCMDraft's previews (e.g. darken unwalkable terrain, color code height)
- Changing Zoom Scale does not save scrolling progress correctly.
- Reuse MiniTiles Duplicates Old/New and Null settings don't work when importing minitile graphics
- Crash when using 'copy group settings' feature
- Crash when using 'Apply to Megas' option when using minitile editor
