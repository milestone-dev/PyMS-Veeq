	Palette View:
- Selecting multiple groups in the main window (mostly for shifting them all to null, applying megatile flags to all of them like walkable/low/med/high etc, and setting them to unbuildable
- Allowing flags to be stored in clipboard and pasted over, ctrl+alt+a to copy all, ctrl+alt+w to copy walkable, ctrl+alt+h to copy height
